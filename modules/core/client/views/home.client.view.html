    <h2>Laboratory Science, Process, Automation, and Engineering</h2>
    <p>We're here to help build a community that facilitates innovation and standardization in all aspects of laboratory technology.
    <p>With a membership consisting of individuals from pharmaceutical and biotechnical industries and also from the many academic institutions. Each year chapters typically hold a Technology Exhibition to showcase the latest in laboratory instrumentation, automation, software, reagents and consumables.  We also host an annual Scientific Meetings in which we strive to present topics ranging from cutting-edge biotechnologies to thought-provoking challenges in todayâ€™s life sciences. Both types of meetings provide a wonderful networking opportunity for scientists and engineers to connect and share ideas. We are continually looking to broaden our scope, and we encourage suggestions for future meeting themes. </p>
